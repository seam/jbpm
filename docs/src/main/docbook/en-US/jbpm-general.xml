  <title>Seam jBPM</title>
  
  <para>Seam provides a convenient method of remotely accessing CDI beans from a web page, using AJAX (Asynchronous
    Javascript and XML). The framework for this functionality is provided with almost no up-front development effort -
    your beans only require simple annotating to become accessible via AJAX. This chapter describes the steps
    required to build an AJAX-enabled web page, then goes on to explain the features of the Seam Remoting framework in
    more detail. </para>
